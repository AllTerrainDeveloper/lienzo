 * The shell owns the actual drop target on every tile, because a tile has to reject
 * foreign payloads rather than let them fall through to the wallpaper underneath.
 * Registering a target on the icon directly is silently displaced. Instead the shell
 * consults a handler registry for its accept predicate, its hover chip and its drop --
 * which is what this registers into.
