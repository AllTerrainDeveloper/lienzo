/**
 * Controls that adapt to the host.
 *
 * Inside OpenStation the shell registers a kit of web components that
 * carry the desktop's theming, spacing and dark-mode handling. Using them makes
 * Lienzo look like it belongs. Outside OpenStation they do not exist, so every
 * factory here builds a plain-DOM equivalent instead.
 *
 * Detection is per tag and happens at build time rather than being inferred from
 * "is OpenStation running". The shell registers a core subset of components
 * eagerly and the rest only when a bundle importing them happens to load, so the
 * only trustworthy question is whether *this* tag is in the custom element registry
 * right now. An unregistered tag renders as inert markup with no error, which is
 * exactly the kind of silent breakage worth spending a `customElements.get()` on.
 *
 * The native fallbacks read OpenStation's CSS custom properties where they exist,
 * so even the fallback path inherits the desktop's palette.
 *
 * This module is the whole public surface. One control per file behind it, so adding
 * a thirteenth does not mean opening the other twelve.
