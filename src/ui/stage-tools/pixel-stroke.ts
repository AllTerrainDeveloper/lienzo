/**
 * The retouching strokes, which read pixels rather than lay down paint.

 * Heal, clone, dodge, burn and the history brush all work the same way: lift the
 * composed document once, walk it dab by dab, and upload only each dab's own dirty
 * rectangle. Reading once per stroke rather than once per dab is what keeps them usable
 * on a big photograph, and uploading only the dirty rectangle is what keeps the cost
 * proportional to the brush rather than to the document.
 *
 * The composed document is the right source because it is what the user sees. The base
 * image layer is not canvas-aligned, so reading it directly would blur the wrong pixels
 * the moment the image had been moved.
