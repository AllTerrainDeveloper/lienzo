/**
 * Host adapters.
 *
 * AllTerrain Photo Editor runs in two worlds: a plain WordPress admin, and inside the shell that is
 * now called OpenStation. Rather than scatter `if ( shell )` through the codebase,
 * every capability that differs between the two is funnelled through this module.
 * The rest of the plugin imports from here and never asks which world it is in.
 *
 * Nothing here hard-depends on the shell. Each adapter feature-detects the exact
 * method it wants and falls back to a plain-DOM implementation, so removing the
 * shell degrades the experience without breaking it.
 *
 * ## Two spellings of everything
 *
 * OpenStation 0.9.9 renamed the whole surface -- `wp.desktop` became `wp.os`,
 * `<wpd-*>` became `<os-*>`, and every event with it. AllTerrain Photo Editor ships to sites running
 * either version and cannot know which, so it asks for capabilities by bare name and
 * this module resolves the spelling. That is why nothing outside here writes a
 * prefix: a hardcoded `wpd-button` is a control that silently renders as inert
 * markup on a current shell, and a hardcoded `os-button` is the same bug in reverse.
