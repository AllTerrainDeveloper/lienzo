/**
 * The edit recipe: the resolution-independent description of an edit.
 *
 * This module is the browser half of a contract whose other half is
 * `includes/recipe.php`. The op list and the validation rules must agree exactly:
 * the client builds a recipe, the server validates and stores it, and the client
 * reads it back to restore every slider. When you add an op, add it here, in
 * `lienzo_op_schema()`, and in `src/engine/color-matrix.ts`.

/**
 * Current recipe schema version.
 *
 * - v2 added `curves` and `levels` beside the scalar `ops`.
 * - v3 replaced the single `geometry` block with a `canvas` and a `layer`. The old
 *   model cropped the source directly, which conflated the surface with what sits
 *   on it; see `src/model/document.ts` for why that had to change.
 * - v4 split the layer's single `scale` into `scaleX` and `scaleY`, so an edge
 *   handle can stretch one axis.
 * - v5 replaced the single `layer` with a `layers` stack, which is what pasting
 *   into a new node requires.
 * - v6 added `space`, the working space the adjustments are computed in. A recipe
 *   without one is sRGB, which is what every recipe written before this was.

 * afterwards, so a stop is a doubling of *light* rather than a doubling of a number
 * that only stands for light. Two stops up on a mid grey is the case that shows it:
 * in sRGB the value saturates, in linear it lands where a camera would have put it.
 * Everything else -- contrast pivoting on mid grey, saturation towards luma, the tone
 * curve -- is defined against the encoded values by construction and stays there.
