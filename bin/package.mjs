/**
 * Builds the release package.
 *
 * Produces two things under `dist/`, matching the two halves of a WordPress.org
 * submission:
 *
 *   dist/allterrain-photo-editor.zip  the plugin itself, in a single `allterrain-photo-editor/`
 *                     folder, so it unpacks to the right slug however it is installed
 *   dist/assets/      the directory listing's banner and icon art, which lives in
 *                     SVN's own `assets/` path and is NOT part of the download
 *
 * Staged into a real directory before zipping rather than filtered on the fly. A zip
 * built by exclusion patterns is a zip nobody can inspect before publishing; a staged
 * tree can be listed, diffed and opened.
 *
 * The zip is built with the system `zip`, which is present on macOS and Linux and
 * needs no dependency. Node has no archiver in its standard library and this is not a
 * good reason to add one.
