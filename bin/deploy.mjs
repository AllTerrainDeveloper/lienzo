/**
 * Syncs the built plugin into the local WordPress Docker instance.
 *
 * The manual-QA site at http://localhost:8889 is the `wordpress-alcazaba`
 * docker-compose project. It bind-mounts its own checkout at /var/www, so anything
 * written into `<checkout>/src/wp-content/plugins/allterrain-photo-editor` is live in the container
 * immediately -- no container restart, no WordPress upload screen.
 *
 * This runs as part of `npm run build`, so every change reaches the site without a
 * separate step. When the WordPress checkout is not present (CI, a fresh clone, a
 * different machine) it prints a note and exits successfully rather than failing the
 * build -- deploying is a convenience, not a build requirement.
 *
 * Override the destination with LIENZO_DEPLOY_TARGET, or skip entirely with
 * LIENZO_SKIP_DEPLOY=1.
