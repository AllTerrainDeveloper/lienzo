/**
 * Plugin Name:       AllTerrain Photo Editor for OpenStation
 * Plugin URI:        https://github.com/AllTerrainDeveloper/allterrain-photo-editor
 * Description:       A modern, non-destructive image editor for the WordPress media library. Exposure, colour and tone adjustments rendered on the GPU, in the browser.
 * Version:           0.1.0
 * Requires at least: 6.0
 * Requires PHP:      7.4
 * Author:            Daniel Lopez
 * License:           GPL-2.0-or-later
 * License URI:       https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html
 * Text Domain:       allterrain-photo-editor
 * Requires Plugins:  desktop-mode
 *
 * AllTerrain Photo Editor is an OpenStation application and requires it. That is not a formality: the
 * rendering library is OpenStation's. AllTerrain Photo Editor ships no PixiJS at all and borrows the
 * shell's, which keeps this plugin a few tens of kilobytes rather than eight hundred,
 * and keeps exactly one Pixi on the page -- two Pixi 8 instances share GPU resource
 * registries through globals, so one copy is not merely smaller but safer.
 *
 * At its best it runs as a **native window** in the shell, rendering into the shell's
 * own DOM: that is what gives the editor OpenStation's components, its drag bridge and
 * its window chrome, none of which is reachable from inside a chromeless iframe.
 *
 * With OpenStation installed but switched *off* for a user -- a per-user preference --
 * there is no shell on the page to render into, and the editor opens on its own admin
 * page under Media and in an overlay instead. `src/platform.ts` resolves every control
 * to a plain-DOM equivalent component by component, and PixiJS is loaded straight from
 * OpenStation's own directory. So classic admin has a real editor; what it does not
 * have is the window, the desktop icon and the drag bridge.
 *
 * With OpenStation absent altogether there is no PixiJS, so nothing loads but the
 * notice on the plugins screen explaining what is missing.
