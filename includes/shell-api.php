 * Naming the shell.
 *
 * The desktop shell was called Desktop Mode and is now called OpenStation, and the
 * rename went all the way down: `desktop_mode_register_window()` became
 * `openstation_register_window()`, and every hook with it. Lienzo ships to sites
 * running either version and cannot know which, so it asks for a capability by its
 * bare name and this file resolves the spelling.
 *
 * Deliberately a lookup rather than a version check. A site mid-upgrade, a fork, or a
 * shell that renames itself again all degrade to "no desktop integration" instead of
 * a fatal error on every request -- which is the same promise the rest of the
 * integration makes.
